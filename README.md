### hi everyone. welcome to mifemiso!
### 

This project of mine holds a special place in my heart. Prior to shifting over to engineering, I’ve worked in women’s health since I was 16 years old. Access to safe abortions for women has always been a passion of mine and while I decided to undertake a new journey, that passion has never changed. 

While studying for a dev job, I’ve been working per diem at a women’s health center I used to work for back when I was in college. While walking through counseling and aftercare with a patient who was going to get a medical abortion, I realized how a patient can quickly get confused on how the process works, simply due to the number of pills involved and the specific timings for taking them. I typically talk my patients through the process and have them repeat it back to me, but a little part of me wished for some sort of calculator that a patient could use when they went home. 

Well, here it is. Mifemiso calculates the times that the different medications should be taken depending on the user calendar input. The app uses the protocol used by the practice I work for.
