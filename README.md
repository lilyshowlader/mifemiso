### hi everyone. welcome to mifemiso!
### 

This project of mine holds a special place in my heart. Prior to shifting over to engineering, I’ve worked in women’s health since I was 16 years old. Access to safe abortions for women has always been a passion of mine and while I decided to undertake a new journey, that passion has never changed.

While navigating my career transition into tech, I’ve been working per diem at a women’s health center I used to work for back when I was in college. While walking through aftercare with a patient who was going to get a medical abortion, I realized how a patient can quickly get confused on how the process works, simply due to the different types of medications and times of when they must be taken. I typically talk my patients through the process and have them repeat it back to me, but a little part of me wished for some sort of patient-facing calculator that a patient could use when they went home. ♥️

Well, here it is ☺️ mifemiso calculates the times that the different medications should be taken depending on the user calendar input. The app uses the protocol used by the practice I work for.
